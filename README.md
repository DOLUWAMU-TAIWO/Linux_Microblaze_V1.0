In the realm of embedded systems, the fusion of adaptable hardware and sophisticated software heralds a new era of innovation. Our project embarks on this journey, harnessing the synergy of FPGA technology with the versatility of Linux, embodied in the MicroBlaze soft processor and the Nexys A7 FPGA board. This convergence is not merely a technical experiment but a bold exploration into creating more efficient, intelligent, and versatile systems.
