# Linux On Microblaze 

## Introduction

In the realm of embedded systems, the fusion of adaptable hardware and sophisticated software heralds a new era of innovation. Our project embarks on this journey, harnessing the synergy of FPGA technology with the versatility of Linux, embodied in the MicroBlaze soft processor and the Nexys A7 FPGA board. This convergence is not merely a technical experiment but a bold exploration into creating more efficient, intelligent, and versatile systems.

## Features

- **Adaptable Hardware:** Linux Based MIcroblaze Processor 
- **Sophisticated Software:**  Custom distrubution of Linux called petalinux completely customizable to user requirement 
- **MicroBlaze Soft Processor:** A key component in our embedded system design.
- **Nexys A7 FPGA Board:** The backbone of our project, providing a robust platform for development.

## Getting Started

(Install Ubuntu 16 LTS, Vivado, Vitis, Petalinux SDK.)
